# Article_Classification
The aim of this project is to develop different models that help in the classification of news content and to test the accuracy of these models. The data was extracted from 'ensonhaber.com' and transferred to mongoDB. Then, a streamlit interface was created where users can classify news content and save it to the database.

The id information about the google document has been removed from the creds file for security reasons.
